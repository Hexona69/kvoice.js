```typescript
import Koice from 'koice';
```

You must have `ffmpeg` in your PATH, or you can specify one

```typescript
const client = new Koice('Your KOOK bot token');
// const client = new Koice('Your KOOK bot token', '/path/to/your/ffmpeg/binary');
```

Connect to WebSocket and retrive RTP URL.

```typescript
client.connectWebSocket("8403799012661514");
```

Start streaming with path to a file or a `stream.Readable`;

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';
const stream = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/music/file');
await client.startStream(stream);
```

or 

```typescript
await client.startStream('/path/to/music/file');
```

You can also start a ZeroMQ server to be able to stream different files without disconnecting. You can do that by invoking `Koice.startServer()` first, then start streaming.

```typescript
await client.startServer();
await client.startStream('/path/to/music/file');
```

And you can also close the ZeroMQ server without stopping the stream, to switch voice channel without streaming again.

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';

const stream = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/music/file');

client.connectWebSocket("8591468140337193");
await client.startServer();

await client.startStream(stream);

await delay(1000);

await client.closeServer();
await client.disconnectWebSocket();

client.connectWebSocket("1586400722913705");
await client.startServer();
```
